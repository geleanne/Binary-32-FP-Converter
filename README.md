# IEEE-754 Binary-32 Floating-Point Converter

This is a web-based IEEE-754 Binary-32 Floating-Point Converter that allows users to convert between decimal and binary representations, including handling special cases like NaN (Not a Number). The application provides detailed steps of the conversion process and displays the final result in both binary and hexadecimal formats. 

This project is developed by Group 8 (S14) as a requirement for the CSARCH2 course.
